# StellarResonance-GWave
Codes developed in Python for my Thesis research on WD binary orbital evolution
Hi! Thanks for checking out my GitHub.
The current codes listed here were developed by me for my thesis research.

The first code (COSMIC filtration) is used to read in a pandas dataframe generated by COSMIC and throw out any sources 
that have merged, have circular orbits, or have an incorrect k-star value (k-star indicates what lifetime stage the star is in)

The second code (FMcKE source finder) is used to take the filtered sources and check them against the 
conditions needed for the FMcKE effect to occur.

The third code (GWave Evol) evolves the dataframe of sources using exclusively gravitational wave emission (Peters and Matthews 1964)

The fourth code (TheNewFMcKE) evolves sources using both gravitational waves and stellar resonance effects detailed in (McKernan/Ford 2016)

All code was written in Jupyter Notebooks using Python 3.7

These are all still being worked and will be edited periodically.
